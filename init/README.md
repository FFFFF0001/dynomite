# README

The `init` directory is the location for all System V init, Upstart, systemd, etc. initialization scripts.

Initialization scripts are named `dynomite_<os>_<initsystem>`.

For example, the script for Ubuntu's Upstart is named `dynomite_ubuntu_upstart` while the script for Redhat Enterprise Linux's (RHEL's) systemd is named `dynomite_rhel_systemd`.
